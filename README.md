This project created by Levenets Denis

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you should write:

## npm install in main directory and download dependencies

and you should repeat this in /server.

Ports 3000 and 4000 must be open, cause you front-end opens on port 3000 and connects to back-end by port 4000.

## node index in /server

Server starts.

## npm start in base dir

Enjoy!
